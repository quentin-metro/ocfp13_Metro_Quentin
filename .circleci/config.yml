# Use the latest 2.1 version of CircleCI pipeline process engine.
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference
version: 2.1

# Orbs are reusable packages of CircleCI configuration that you may share across projects, enabling you to create encapsulated, parameterized commands, jobs, and executors that can be used across multiple projects.
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/orb-intro/
orbs:
  python: circleci/python@1.5.0

# Define a job to be invoked later in a workflow.
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference/#jobs
jobs:
  build-and-test: 
    docker:
      - image: cimg/python:3.10.2
    # Checkout the code as the first step. This is a dedicated CircleCI step.
    # The python orb's install-packages step will install the dependencies from a Pipfile via Pipenv by default.
    # Here we're making sure we use just use the system-wide pip. By default it uses the project root's requirements.txt.
    # Then run your tests!
    # CircleCI will report the results back to your VCS provider.
    steps:
      - checkout # Setup environnement + install dependecies
      - python/install-packages:
          pkg-manager: pip
      - run:
          name: Run tests
          command: pytest

# Invoke jobs via workflows
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference/#workflows
workflows:
  sample: # This is the name of the workflow, feel free to change it to better match your workflow.
    # Inside the workflow, you define the jobs you want to run.
    jobs:
      - build-and-test
